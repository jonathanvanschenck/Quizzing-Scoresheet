        <h3>Overall Responsibilities</h3>
        <ol type="I">
          <li>
            Overall responsibilities and tips for scorekeepers:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Keep score legibly and consistently. This makes life easier for the statistician.
                <ul>
                  <li>Use a dark pencil so you can cleanly erase corrections.</li>
                  <li>Avoid any extraneous markings.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Announce the score often. At least every 5 questions is a good rule of thumb.</li>
              <li>When you announce the score, verify that the coaches have the same score.</li>
              <li>Fill in each quizzer’s individual score (even if it’s 0), as well as team raw score and team points.</li>
              <li>Have each coach initial the score sheet after the quiz. Coaches that do not promptly initial the score sheet have “implicitly” verified their team’s and individual’s scores.</li>
              <li>Have the winning team take the score sheet to the stats room.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
